\title{Hurricanes: the female of the species in no more deadly than the male}

\begin{article}
\begin{abstract}
{A re-analysis of the data on damage, death toll, strength, and name of hurricanes provided by Jung {\em  et al.} \cite{1} suggests that feminine-names hurricanes do not cause more deaths, because the effects of damage had been mis-specified.}
\end{abstract}

\keywords{hurricanes | gender | residuals | plotting}

\abbreviations{AIC, Akaike's Information Criterion}

Jung {\em et al.} \cite{1} recently used the analyses of data on hurricanes to conclude that if hurricanes were more powerful, they were more deadly when the names were perceived as being more feminine. I suggest that this result was an artefact of using a model that fits poorly, and this an be seen using standard methods to explore the fit of a model.\\

I refitted the the authors' model, and examined the fit by plotting the residuals against the covariates in the model (e.g. \cite{2}). If the model is fitting the data well, these plots should not have any obvious structure. However, the plot of the residuals against normalized damage reveals a distinctly curved shape (Figure~\ref{fig:residplots}a).\\

The model can be improved by adding the square root of damage as a term. The residuals are then clearly less structured (Figure~\ref{fig:residplots}b), and the model fit is also improved (AIC for original model: 660.7, AIC for model with square root term: 634.9) In addition, perceived feminity no longer has an effect (Table~\ref{tab:ParEsts}), and removing the terms involving perceived feminity leads to a more parsimonious model (AIC: 630.1).\\

From a purely statistical perspective, it is clear that we have found a better model, and it suggests that feminity of hurricane names does not have an effect: the results in \cite[1] are an artefact of the model mis-fit, and classical model checking approaches clearly demonstrate this, and lead us to a better model. But one should not take a purely statistical approach: expert knowledge (of those studying responses to disaster) is also needed to evaluate the model. Here the main issue is whether it is more likely that the effects of damage are non-linear, or whether they are linear and an effect of hurricane name, and if the latter model is still to be preferred despite its poorer fit.
